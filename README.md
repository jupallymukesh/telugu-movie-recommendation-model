# Telugu Movie Recommendation System

## Project Description
This project is a Telugu Movie Recommendation System built using Python. It leverages two datasets and utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm with cosine similarity to recommend movies based on user preferences.

## Features
- Recommend Telugu movies based on user preferences.
- Utilizes KNN algorithm for finding similar movies.
- Employs cosine similarity to measure the similarity between movie features.

## Datasets
- **Dataset 1**: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/itschannel/telugu-movies-dataset]
  - Contains information about Telugu movies including genres, ratings, etc.
- **Dataset 2**: user_movie_ratings
  - Includes user ratings or other relevant data to improve recommendation accuracy.

## Algorithm
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm was used to find movies similar to the ones a user likes. We utilized cosine similarity to measure the similarity between different movies based on their features (e.g., ratings.....). Cosine similarity helps in identifying how closely related two movies are, making it effective for recommendation systems.
